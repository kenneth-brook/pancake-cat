			<h1>Broodin's Vision</h1>
			<p>
				My platform for CSM is simple, solve problems at or as close to their
				source as possible and in the most logical way possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				We want more smaller groups in EvE rather than a solid blue doughnut of
				mega coalitions. One of the ways this can be incentivized is to develop
				and publish corp / alliance tools such as an ESI check program along
				with SOV and structure management tools. This method is designed to
				enable smaller, newer groups who would otherwise lack the tools needed
				to effectively administrate a community in EvE.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another concept is to develop, at the CSM and CCP levels, a set of
				specific and measurable criteria which “New Player Friendly” groups can
				aspire to. Those that meet the criteria set forth would be included in a
				list which randomizes the “New player Friendly” groups and is unsortable
				to avoid any size or alphabetical preference. This list should function
				more in line with the structure browser in design with shaded or
				illuminated icons for what the group focuses on and include basic
				information on the groups identity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The list should be put forth front during the initial introduction to
				the game in order to get new players connected rapidly with the
				community. This would allow CCP to satisfy their desire to tinker with
				the New Player Experience and also incentivize groups who want to
				participate to treat new players well and help them to get a footing in
				game rather than functioning as a meat grinder.
