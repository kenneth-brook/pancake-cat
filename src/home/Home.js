				<h1>Broodin's Vision</h1>
			</div>

			<p>
				My platform for CSM is simple, solve problems at or as close to their
				source as possible and in the most logical way possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will often hear me say things such as “a pessimist says no one
				should have that… an optimist says everyone should be able to have
				that”. This is because I have a less common outlook on gaming in general
				and a deliberate approach to my problem-solving process in EvE. My
				background in the military has made me quite weary of the “good idea
				fairy” approach and the damage that a stupid idea can cause to the
				average person’s caught in a bad situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				My background in EvE includes years in leadership of a small industrial
				Corp and the last year has been spent leading and developing Karmafleet
				University, a highsec teaching and training division of Karmafleet. My
				experience in being immersed in both large and small groups along with
				having lived in multiple areas of the game over the last half a decade
				leaves me with some unique perspectives on the problems facing EvE.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						1. I would venture to say that as a community, we want more smaller
						groups in EvE rather than a solid blue doughnut of mega coalitions.
						One of the ways this can be incentivized is to develop and publish
						corp / alliance tools such as an ESI check program along with SOV
						and structure management tools at the CCP level. This method is
						designed to enable smaller, newer groups who would otherwise lack
						the tools needed to effectively administrate a community in EvE.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						2. A problem which is often debated but rarely approached is the
						difficulty of connecting new players to the EvE community. My
						approach would be to develop, at the CSM and CCP levels, a set of
						specific and measurable criteria which “New Player Friendly” groups
						can aspire to. Those that meet the criteria set forth would be
						included in a list which randomizes the “New Player Friendly” groups
						and is unsortable to avoid any size or alphabetical preference. This
						list should function more in line with the structure browser in
						design with shaded or illuminated icons for what the group focuses
						on and include basic information on the groups identity.
					</p>
					<p>
						The list should be put forth front during the initial introduction
						to the game in order to get new players connected rapidly with the
						community. This would allow CCP to satisfy their desire to tinker
						with the New Player Experience and also incentivize groups who want
						to participate to treat new players well and help them to get a
						footing in game rather than functioning as a meat grinder.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						3. There are always questions and concerns on the EvE economy and
						general gameplay experience. My viewpoint on this is simple… Quit
						throwing crap ideas at the wall and hoping that something sticks.
						Scarcity and the industry changes are a sham. A completely knee jerk
						reaction to a problem that was created by the introduction of
						Excavator Drones into the game. Belts, anomalies, moons, mineral
						distribution, blueprint and reaction changes and the overall drought
						of materials in the game have all been forcefully tinkered with when
						NONE were the initiator of the market upheaval to begin with.
					</p>
					<p>
						Remove excavators from the game, refund their value by converting
						the existing drones into an appropriate number of augmented or
						harvester mining drones and then roll back every unnecessary and
						harmful change made during the scarcity era.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This game exists today as the greatest sandbox MMO in existence, holding
				several Guinness Records and bringing thousands together in both common
				interest and in conflict. Work with that fact, administrate and play the
				game as it is today, not what you wish it was or your desires from a
				decade past. EvE is not great because of game designers sitting in a
				backroom writing lore; it is great because players make the stories that
				fill volumes of text and several books
			</p>
			<p>
				The best days of New Eden are not behind us if we are diligent as a
				community to ensure its future is bright and productive, with many wars
				and many more stories to be made along the path.
