			<h1>Broodin's Vision</h1>
			<p>
				My platform for CSM is simple, solve problems at or as close to their
				source as possible and in the most logical way possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will often hear me say things such as “a pessimist says no one
				should have that… an optimist says everyone should be able to have
				that”. This is because I have a less common outlook on gaming in general
				and a deliberate approach to my problem-solving process in EvE. My
				background in the military has made me quite wary of the “good idea
				fairy” approach and the damage that a stupid idea can cause to the
				average person’s caught in a bad situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				My background in EvE includes years in leadership of a small industrial
				Corp. The last year has been spent leading and developing Karmafleet
				University, a highsec teaching, and training division of Karmafleet. My
				experience in being immersed in large and small groups and having lived
				in multiple areas of the game over the last half a decade leaves me with
				some unique perspectives on the problems facing EvE.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						1. As a community, I would venture to say that we want smaller
						groups in EvE rather than a solid blue doughnut of mega coalitions.
						One way this can be incentivized is to develop and publish corp /
						alliance tools such as an ESI check program and SOV and structure
						management tools at the CCP level. This method is designed to enable
						smaller, newer groups who would otherwise lack the tools needed to
						administrate a community in EvE effectively.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						2. An often-debated problem but rarely approached is the difficulty
						of connecting new players to the EvE community. My approach would be
						to develop, at the CSM and CCP levels, a set of specific and
						measurable criteria which “New Player Friendly” groups can aspire
						to. Those that meet the requirements set forth would be included in
						a list that randomizes the “New Player Friendly” groups and is
						unsortable to avoid any size or alphabetical preference. This list
						should function more in line with the structure browser in design
						with shaded or illuminated icons. The group focuses on and includes
						basic information on the group's identity.
					</p>
					<p>
						The list should be put forth front during the initial introduction
						to the game to get new players connected rapidly with the community.
						This would allow CCP to satisfy their desire to tinker with the New
						Player Experience and incentivize groups who want to participate in
						treating new players well and helping them get a footing in-game
						rather than functioning as a meat grinder.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						3. There are always questions and concerns about the EvE economy and
						general gameplay experience. My viewpoint on this is simple… Quit
						throwing crap ideas at the wall and hoping that something sticks.
						Scarcity and the industry changes are a sham, a complete knee-jerk
						reaction to a problem created by the introduction of Excavator
						Drones into the game. Belts, anomalies, moons, mineral distribution,
						blueprint, and response changes, and the widespread drought of
						materials in the game have all been forcefully tinkered with when
						NONE were the initiator of the market upheaval, to begin with.
					</p>
					<p>
						Remove excavators from the game, refund their value by converting
						the existing drones into an appropriate number of augmented or
						harvester mining drones, and then roll back every unnecessary and
						harmful change made during the scarcity era.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Today, this game exists as the greatest sandbox MMO in existence,
				holding several Guinness Records and bringing thousands together in
				common interests and conflict. Work with that fact, administrate and
				play the game as it is today, not what you wish it were or your desires
				from a decade past. EvE is not great because of game designers sitting
				in a backroom writing lore; it is excellent because players make the
				stories that fill volumes of text and several books.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best days of New Eden are not behind us if we are diligent as a
				community to ensure its future is bright and productive, with many wars
				and many more stories to be made along the path.
