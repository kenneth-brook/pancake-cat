						Eve Online is a space-based, persistent world massively multiplayer
						online role-playing game developed and published by CCP Games.
						Players of Eve Online can participate in a number of in-game
						professions and activities, including mining, piracy, manufacturing,

					<h4>What is a CSM?</h4>
				</div>
				<div className='questionBody'>
					<p>
						The Council of Stellar Management is a player advocacy group,
						consisting of 10 members democratically elected by the players to
						advise and assist CCP in the continuous development of EVE Online.
						The CSM brings focused and structured feedback from the community to
						CCP and represents their views and interests.
					</p>
					<p>
						The role of a CSM member is to represent the players in the ongoing
						development of EVE Online by providing analysis, sharing
						suggestions, and giving feedback based on the ongoing community
						discussions and concerns to CCP. As an elected representative, a CSM
						member will have clear communication paths with CCP and a chance to
						influence the development of EVE Online many times during their
						term.
